This is my solution to homework 18 for data bootcamp


## Analysis
I wanted to see if as the seasons changed, it would affect riders. Specifically, when they ride, what they ride, and who rides the bikes. We can see on the Riders By Month Dashboard that not much changes as the seasons and months progress. From May-September of 2022, it was consistent that riders would most likely rent a bike during the week. This makes sense as it can be used as a form of transportation to work. During the warmer months, we can see an increase in use on the weekends. This again seems logical since it is nice weather, making it much easier to enjoy Citi Bikes. During this time frame, we can also see an increase in casual and member riders rending Citi Bikes each month. This is very encouraging, showing that as the weather warms we can expect growth in business. When we hit September, we did see a decrease in both. As for ride types, classic bikes are the clear favorite for our riders, no matter the season. We have a very small amount of riders using the docked bike. We may want to look into whether is it worth it to keep the docked bike.

I looked more into trip starting and ending times. For both, we see two peaks of usage around 8 a.m and 6 p.m. This again shows that a lot of our riders use the Citi Bikes as a mode of transportation to work. From looking at the Popular Trip Time Dashboard, we can see that May to June has an increase in users, and in August we get another big increase in the steepness. Showing that in the heat of summer, we are seeing an increase in business.

Looking at the End Station Map and Starting Station Map we can see that the stations are the same. This could mean that we have riders that are starting and ending their trips in the same locations. Five of the stations are right by the coast, which could mean some of our riders are using bikes to ride along the coast. Two stations are by major traffic areas, the Holland Tunnel, and a light rail. This could mean that riders are using bikes to get to and from other transportation stations.
